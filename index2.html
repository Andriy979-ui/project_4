                                     <h1 class="Sam"> Ready Repair</h1>
<p>He first appears in the "Ready Repair" minigame. When you meet him, your task is to help clean, paint, and decorate his house until its good as new. In the cleaning section of the minigame, there is a broom to clean the cobwebs, a sponge, and a water bucket to refill the sponge located on the right of your screen. In the painting section, you can freely paint the walls with white, red, black, orange, pink, yellow, purple, green, blue, and cyan paint. After completing this segment and clicking next, Sam, along with the game, will shortly glitch out and Sam will take on a distorted appearance for a moment. In the decorating section, you can place a variety of different furniture. One of these is a taped body with a black square censoring it. Clicking it deletes all of the decorations placed and your mouse moves by itself to drag the body across the floor. After the cutscene, Sam will jumpscare you and is not seen after this.</p>

                                     <h1 class="Jade" >Factory Frenzy!</h1>
<p>Factory Frenzy!
She first appears in the "Factory Frenzy!" minigame. When you meet her, your task is to help her build toys in her toy factory. To do this task, you have to drag and drop parts of the toys from the conveyer belt on the bottom of your screen to the toy's outline next to Jade. First, you must help her build a car. After completing this segment, Jade, along with the game, will shortly glitch out and Jade's body and the rest of the minigame will disappear for a moment. Second, you help her build a bicycle. This segment is interrupted by a liver appearing on the conveyer belt. Clicking it will result in the game and Jade glitching and becoming distorted for a short time, along with Jade jumpscaring you. Third, you must help her build a teddy bear, and lastly, you help her build a robot. In the middle of the robot building segment, you will receive an email titled "IT'S NOT TOO LATE". By opening this email, you are met by what seems to be gibberish text and question marks. A QR code is seen by scrolling further down in the email, which brings you to an image of a keyboard. When you try to open the email in the midst of playing the minigame, Kinito will shortly yell at you and discourage you from looking at the email. Jade is not seen in the rest of the game after completing the minigame.</p>
